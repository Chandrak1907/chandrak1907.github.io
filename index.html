      <p>I am a Technical Director (AI) at Oracle’s Cloud Engineering Services Division. My primary responsibility at Oracle is to drive cloud consumption through implementation of AI/Data science projects with consumers across different domains. As part of my job I interact with C-suite executives to develop the AI/Data Science strategy and also lead implementation of AI projects through Oracle technologies.</p>
      <p>Prior to Oracle, I was a Lead Data Scientist at CVS-Aetna. I led multiple data science projects focused on improving health outcomes of Aetna members. Causal Inference techniques (such as Double Machine Learning), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning were used for delivering these projects. Some of my work was accepted for poster presentation at the Academy of health’s Annual Research Meeting (ARM).</p>
